    <!-- <p>Finding a new poet
        is like finding a new wildflower
        out in the woods. You don't see
        
        its name in the flower books, and
        nobody you tell believes
        in its odd color or the way
        
        its leaves grow in splayed rows
        down the whole length of the page. In fact
        the very page smells of spilled
        
        red wine and the mustiness of the sea
        on a foggy day—the odor of truth
        and of lying.
